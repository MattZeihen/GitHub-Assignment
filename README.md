# GitHub-Assignment

### What is this?

This is the final homework assignment of the MAGD 150-1 intro to MAGD class for UW-Whitewater

### What are the 3 assignments?
These 3 Assignments are 3 of the assignments I feel that I performed the best at during the course of the semester

#### Assignment number 5

This assignment covers a few important bases when it comes to designing a program, and that is user interactivity. Assignment 5 was one of the more important assignments because it enabled me to have the user interact with the code in new ways that are usefull in their own context.

#### Assignment number 6

This assignment was uniquely challenging in the fact that I had to maintain the existance of the raindrops even after they fell off the screen, long enough to redraw them at the top of the screen so that the raindrop would not appear to teleport to the top of the screen.

#### Assignment number 7 

Assignment 7 was an interesting venture, because while it was not very different technically from what I had achieved in assignment 6, it was less than optimal the way the code had wanted to deal with how I had Pacman's food moving. My biggest complaint would be that I couldn't change how aggravating the movement is to a viewers eyes.
